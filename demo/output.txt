In a flow reactor were combined C1(Cl)=CC(=C(Br)C=N1)Cl (1.0 eq., 0.3M in C1CCOC1) dosed in at a flow rate of 17 mL min⁻¹ and CCCCCC[Li] (1.1 eq., 2.3M in CCCCCC) dosed in at a flow rate of 2.439 mL min⁻¹ to a T-mixer(φ=500 µm). The resulting mixture was held for a residence time of 1.0 s at a bath T of -70°C, with an in-line T of -50°C, prior to being combined with C[Si](C)(Cl)C (1.2 eq., 1.0M in C1CCOC1) dosed in at a flow rate of 6.12 mL min⁻¹ to a T-mixer(φ=500 µm). The resulting mixture was held for a residence time of 6.0 s at a bath T of -70°C, prior to being collected into NH4Cl. Steady state collection was performed by infusing at least 3 residence times of all feed solutions through the reactor. Yields are reported on this basis. N1C(Cl)=CC(=C(C=1)[Si](C)(C)C)Cl was obtained in 70% yield by 1H NMR measurement.
